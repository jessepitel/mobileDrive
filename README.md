## Testing the iPad Interface ##
Open the mobileDrive/mobileDrive.xcodeproj using XCode click play button.
Click on "Need Help?" in the right hand cornner if you need help.

NOTE:
Everything works on the iPad interface, but you can only mess around with
directories

## Testing the Web Interface ##
Once the iPad application is up and running you can get to the web
interface by typing in the IP address, located at the bottom of the iPad
window, into your vavorite web browsser address bar.

Double click the desired directory to navigate to it. Files can be sorted by
clicking on the respective header (name, type, etc).

NOTE:
Currently the only thing that is working on the web browser is adding
directories.

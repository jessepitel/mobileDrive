## Testing the Web Interface ##
Open the mobileDrive/web/index.html file in a modern web browser (such as
Google Chrome, Firefox, or Safari). File manipulation itself is not

Double click the desired directory to navigate to it. Files can be sorted by
clicking on the respective header (name, type, etc).
